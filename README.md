# java
I am recently learning JAVA from scratch. So to keep the codes in track, I have created this repo.I will keep on commiting in it until I learn completely.
Maybe in future I or someone else will find it useful while learning.
First, the language fundamentals then DSA on this language then cp tricks. Between these, I will add the collection frameworks and core java things and concurrent programming too.
It will the coding documentation first for JAVA. Then  I will move to the theoretical documentation that I have understood till now following JAVA.
Happy Coding :)
